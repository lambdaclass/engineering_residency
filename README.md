# engineering_residency
A version of the LambdaClass Hacking Learning Path aimed at self-guided learners.

Welcome to the LambdaClass Engineering Residency Self-learning Path! (name is a work in progress).
It is similar to the Hacking Learning Path but tailored to self-guided newcomers.

This guide consists of curated material to learn and put in practice.
There is written content, links to valuable online posts, selected book chapters, and projects with guidelines and tests.
To complete the residency program, you must read the material from start to finish and develop the projects as you encounter them in their relevant sections.

The program is self-paced, but is designed to be doable in about a month of part-time dedication.
Once you have completed the program, you can let us know and we will schedule a few interviews to talk about your experience and go over your projects.
