# Rust Project: Merkle Tree

Merkle trees have become an important data structure to understand, and have wide applicability including in areas that are not blockchain-related.
The goal of this project is to create your own library crate in Rust that implements a Merkle tree.
- A Merkle Tree can be built out of an array.
- A Merkle Tree can generate a proof that it contains an element.
- A Merkle Tree can verify that a given hash is contained in it.
- A Merkle Tree can be dynamic, this means that elements can be added once it is built.

We suggest starting simple, do not optimize prematurely because it's pretty sure that you're not gonna need those optimizations.
